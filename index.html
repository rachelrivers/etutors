The majority of schools in the United States will be transitioning to the virtual classroom in some form during the upcoming school year. Some students may struggle with online learning, that's where the eTutors come in! Welcome to the Eureka Center, our virtual learning classroom. The eTutors are here to help students by implementing learning objectives that improve self-sufficiency with online learning, as well as promote enjoyment and success while you learn! We are constantly adapting to the online learning environment by staying up to date on the latest technologies and introducing many diverse tools for learning such as Upswing, Canvas, and Buncee. We also have upcoming webinars and workshops to help families become more acquainted with these programs. Academic coaches are available for one-on-one meetings, or can be reached on Zoom Monday through Friday 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. Contact the team to learn more.</p>

                It is not clear whether the positive effects of game-based learning stem from greater time spent learning, or increased efficiency in learning, or both. It is clear, however, that more time is spent learning when educational games are used than when they are not.

                Here at eTutors, we're putting that theory to the test by offering our students the opportunity to test and even build upon their knowledge while having fun at our <b>Eureka Center! </b>
