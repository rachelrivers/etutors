Parents are trying to keep students on track with their studies while teachers must provide lesson plans and learning activities online. That's why we hope this growing list of resources offers help for parents, students, and teachers!</p>

            <div class="resources_content">
            <p>
                Even if a student is only taking remote courses temporarily it can be a big change from the way they are used to learning. Here are some simple tips from the eTutors to help you successfully navigate the remote learning environment. 
            </p>
            <p><h4>During Class Time</h4>
                <ul>        
            <li>Be present- don't multitask! Close unnecessary websites like email, messaging, and social media.</li>
            <li>Be prepared with your reading and assignments in front of you. Have a notebook ready to take notes like you would in person. </li>
            <li> Participate if you can- use chat messaging, discussion boards, or voice calls. Be sure to ask questions! Use those channels of communication or find out your teacher's office hours, email, and telephone number. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                Make sure you are using the above points to keep an eye on deadlines. Actively manage your responsibilities to make sure your assignments are completed. Find out how to turn in assignments virtually- <b>make sure to read your syllabus instructions and ask your teacher! </b>
            </p>
            <p><h4>Create Space for Learning</h4></p>
            <p>Find a suitable space for when you are in class so you can remain focused. An ideal space would be an area where you have control over your desk so that nobody can come and move your books or papers while you are away. Also the ideal learning area is quiet, minimize disruptions as much as possible! </p>
            <p><h4>Make Time, Manage Your Time</h4></p>
            <p><ul>Make a schedule for: 
                <li> When you need to be online for class.</li>
                <li>When you will do your assignments.</li>
                <li>When you have quizzes or tests.</li>
                <li>When you have meetings with the eTutors.</li> </ul></p>
            <p>
                Try to stick with a routine similar to the way you would when you attend school in person. Tell your family members and your eTutor so they can hold you accountable for this schedule. 
            </p>
            <p>Check Your Email or Class Messaging Board at Least Twice a Day</p>
            <p>Begin each day by checking your school email account or class messaging boards. Write notes and add changes to your calendar. </p>
            <p>Try to Work on Every Subject Every Day</p>
            <p><ul><li>Practice your readings, homework, and other assignments for each class every day, even if it's just a small amount. This helps you keep track of your progress in every course! </li>
                <li>Switching tasks instead of the same one for hours. Your brain focuses best on one task for about 45-60 minutes. Take breaks to stretch or have a healthy snack before going back to your work.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>Communication is Key!</p>
            <p><b>It can be harder for teachers or your eTutors to notice the obstacles you are facing remotely. If you are having issues contact them immediately. Don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for help! </b></p>
